**iso3166-2** is a lightweight custom-built Python package, and accompanying API, that can be 
used to access all of the world's ISO 3166-2 subdivision data. Here, subdivision can be used 
interchangably with regions/states/provinces etc. Currently, the package and API supports 
data from 250 countries/territories, according to the ISO 3166-1 standard. The software uses 
another custom-built Python package called `iso3166-updates <https://github.com/amckenna41/iso3166-updates/>`_ 
to ensure all the subdivision data is accurate, reliable and up-to-date. The ISO 3166-2 was first published in 1998 
and as of November 2023 there are 5,039 codes defined in it.

There are 7 main data attributes available for each subdivision within the ISO 3166-2 software:

* Name - subdivsion name, as it is commonly known in English
* Local name - subdivision name in local language
* Code - ISO 3166-2 subdivision code
* Parent Code - subdivision's parent code
* Type - subdivision type, e.g. region, state, canton, parish etc
* Latitude/Longitude - subdivision coordinates
* Flag - subdivsion flag from `iso3166-flag-icons <https://github.com/amckenna41/iso3166-flag-icons/>`_ repo

.. note::

    A demo of the software and accompanying API is 
    available `here <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1btfEx23bgWdkUPiwdwlDqKkmUp1S-_7U?usp=sharing/>`_!
